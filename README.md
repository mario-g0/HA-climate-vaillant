# HA-climate-vaillant
This is my configuation of the Broadlink Climate Component for Home Assistant

It uses a custom component created by vpnmaster https://github.com/vpnmaster/homeassistant-custom-components

I use it to control my "non-smart" Vaillant climaVAIR AC unit via a [Broadlink RM mini 3](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/NeRezXE), of which I recorded the IR packets and compiled the .ini file required by the component.

This is the result in the HA frontend:
